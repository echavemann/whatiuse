# Java

AWS Lang. Honestly my least favorite tool. Let's keep this one quick.

## IntelliJ
Jetbrain's flagship IDE. Makes Java slightly less painful to use than ARM or RISC-V. IntelliJ is fantastic for Kotlin, but I am not a huge fan of it for Java. I use it for Java because it is the best option, but I would much rather use Kotlin in any case where I have the option.

### Setup: [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
You will use your company's license server here. If you are buying IntelliJ with your own money, please consider what you are doing with your life.
