We all saw this coming. 

## Lunarvim
Find my `init.lua` in the same directory as this file. For the unitiated, Vim keybinds are the correct and only correct way to edit text documents. The learning curve is absolutely not easy to progress through, but it is absolutely worth it. It multiplies my productivity by a factor of 10, and I can't imagine going back. Vim really allows you to make progress towards writing code at the speed of thought, and for that it cannot be beat. The importance of vim cannot be understated.

I use LunarVim because I feel that it has a lot of sensible defaults without adding too much weight to the proper Neovim experience. Essential plugins include the absolutely incredible Fugitive and the language tools outlined in the other documents. My configuration is geared towards quick, bursty code sessions or patches, as I like to use full fat IDEs for very large changes - see the C++ page for more info on that. Of course, there are plenty of different vim distributions, I just think Lunar allows me to spend the least time tinkering and the most time working. 

There are also CP keybinds in there if that is what you want.
