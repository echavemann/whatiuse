# Python
If you know me you know I am a massive Python hater. That being said, I can't deny it's usefulness and use it all the time for rapid prototyping - it's the 3D printer of programming lnaguages. Please do not make me code review your Python code.

## Environment
I personally prefer virtualenv for environment management because it is very lightweight, as well as Poetry for dependency management. Both are super easy to setup and very intuitive, with poetry in particular fixing a lot of my complaints about the python build system.

## Top Libraries
CPP_IMPORT/Pybind is ironically my most used library, followed by Polars which is a lot like Pandas, as well as NumPy.

### Setup
Just head to Python.com and download whatever you need, or use the appropriate package manager for your OS. I like 3.11 a lot because it is much less slow than other options.
