# Terminal

I use Windows Terminal on Windows, Warp on MacOS, and Hyper on Linux. Let's go through each one.

## Windows Terminal
Windows terminal, introduced in Windows 10, is surprisingly a legit good terminal emulator from the makers of Edge, as shocking as that is. It has great support for WSL, my primary development environment, looks great out of the box, was super easy to get Night Owl onto, and is just generally a great experience. I use it with the Jetbrains Mono font and icon pack.

## Warp
Warp is my personal king of terminal emulators. It is fast, has an incredible suite of features including automatically expanding aliases, predicting and suggesting similar commands, and has Night Owl baked in. Their context-based feature selection is second to none, and rolls up everything that I generally combine multiple services into just one super slick terminal. Unfortunately they are closed source, MacOS only, and seem to develop extremely slowly, so I am not sure how long I will be waiting to use it on other platforms.

## Hyper
Hyper is probably the third place here. It is a great emulator, and has the benefit of being open source, but it was always slow and a little bit of a chore to configure for me. However, it is world's better than a lot of other options, and is a great choice if you are on Linux. Once you get it wired up the way you want it, it is a lot like Warp in terms of features, but it is a much more of a pain to get there.

## Starship
Starship is a Rust built prompt - not a terminal. I use starship in conjunction with both Windows Terminal and Hyper, and it is fantastic. It can be installed via `cargo`, the Rust package manager (and also just a fantastic package manager). It is really easy to get a very nice and informative setup, but of course you can sink hundreds of hours into building it just how you want it.
